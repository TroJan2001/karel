Karel Assignment: Map Division into Chambers

Objective
The goal of this project is to divide a given map into 4 equal chambers using Karel the Robot.
If the map cannot be evenly divided into 4 chambers, Karel should divide it into the largest possible number of equal chambers (3, 2, or 1). 
The solution must optimize the use of beepers and minimize Karel's moves.

Requirements
Programming Language: Java
Constraints: Use only functions provided in Karel's reference card. No classes API allowed except for initializing Karel's bag with beepers.
Optimizations:
1- Minimize the number of moves Karel makes.
2- Write reusable functions to reduce the overall lines of code.
3- Use the minimum number of beepers necessary to achieve the task
